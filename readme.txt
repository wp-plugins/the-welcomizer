-> [Demo](http://www.sebastien-laframboise.com/wordpress/plugins-wordpress/the-welcomizer/) | [Twiz file](http://www.sebastien-laframboise.com/the-welcomizer.twz) - (The twz file is there for you to understand how I did it. It won't work on your Website of course...) I lost a rating star yesterday, I am sad, someone have voted 1 star. I wonder why, I did not received any explanations. Yesterday I needed to move my website to another server because of the popularity of The Welcomizer...Thanks for rating my plugin! And if you are the one who vote down my plugin, send me a email, and tell me why?

Thanks for your feedback and your support!

Stay tuned, and do your updates...

The Welcomizer has Spirit!

Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= I've translated your awesome plugin in MyLanguage. Could I send you the .po and .mo files? =

Yes, I will include your translation in future releases. E-mail me at `wordpress [at] sebastien-laframboise [dot] com`

= How to bring my element from outside the screen with an opacity effect? =
 
1. Add this style below to your HTML element: 

   style="position: absolute; opacity: 0; filter: alpha(opacity=0); z-index: 1;"

2. Adjust the starting position inside the editing panel. (e.g. Top: - 400 px , position: absolute)

3. Adjust the Top of the first move. (e.g. Top: + 800 px), reverse it for the second move.

4. Add the option 'opacity:1' for the first move, reverse it for the second move.

Note: (Advanced) Keep in mind that you can add more - $(this).animate({},xx); - inside the two Extra JavaScript textboxes.
